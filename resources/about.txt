Previous Folders is a lightweight download manager that does not clutter the Firefox user interface since it uses the already present feature provided by Windows Explorer. This extension was created to speed up the selection of folders when you download files into various locations.

<b>Features</b>

<li>Save and access previous download locations using the drop-down list in File Picker dialog. You can open this list when you click on the small down arrow on the right side of the address bar.</li>
<li><i>Optional:</i> Disable site-specific download locations. When enabled, last download location is saved globally and not separately for each site.</li>
<li><i>Optional:</i> Remove completed downloads from the Downloads window based on the file extension.</li>


<b>Notes</b>
By default download locations are saved automatically and the list holds 25 last folders. In the options dialog users can disable or enable the automatic saving. Private Browsing Mode is honored, and no saving is done when it is activated. There is also an option to ignore Windows temp folder that might otherwise pop up into the list unintentionally when users open files directly from the browser.

Since Firefox 7, last download folder is selected based on the site the download is coming from. This feature can be disabled from the options dialog. Previously stored locations can also be cleared using the <i>Clear</i> button in options.

As a bonus the extension has an ability to automatically remove completed downloads from Firefox's Downloads windows based on the file extension. The list of file extensions is configurable, and you can for example remove most image downloads by inserting <i>"jpg;png;gif"</i> in options. By default this feature is disabled.

Users should be advised that this extension reads and writes into Windows registry. Addresses are saved into registry under the key:
Windows 7: <i>"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\TypedPaths"</i>
Windows Vista: <i>"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs"</i>

Because of the availability of the drop-down list feature, this extension works only in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, not in Windows XP or other operating systems.
